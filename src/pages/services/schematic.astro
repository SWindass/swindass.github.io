        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-navy mb-4">
          Quality is our focus at every stage of the development; we use schematic design constraints to ensure the final PCB meets requirements for high-speed signals, power signals, manufacturability, testability and compliance such as EMC and safety requirements, in a controlled and repeatable way.
